\details{
\strong{DER algorithm}

The steps of DER algorithm are described below:

\strong{1.} The function DER calculates the most often used indices (see below): a total of 39 indices that includes 2 of rarity, 14 of heterogeneity, 7 of evenness, 2 of taxonomic diversity, 8 of phylogenetic diversity and 6 of functional diversity. It is important to mention that the indices included in the groups of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity, each explores a different facet of phylogenetic diversity (Kembel et al., 2010) and functional diversity (Laliberté et al., 2010), respectively.

This index is a novel contribution of this package, where \emph{S} is the number of species (species richness), \emph{s} is the number of samples, \eqn{r_{ij}} is the number of records of the species \emph{i} in the sample \emph{j}, \emph{R} is the total number of records considering all the species in all samples.

}
\strong{2.} Each index is transformed to a scale range between 0 and 1 for all samples with the following equation:
\deqn{\frac{(index of the sample-min)}{(max-min)}}

where \emph{min} and \emph{max} are the minimum and maximum values of the index considering all samples, respectively.

\strong{3.} With the standardized values of the indices, the algorithm calculates the polar coordinates of all samples with all possible combinations among all groups of indices. Therefore, in each combination an index of each group of rarity, heterogeneity (species richness is included in this group), evenness, taxonomic/ phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (if it is included functional traits in the analysis) is used for calculating the polar coordinates of all samples. In the group of taxonomic/phylogenetic diversity the user must use either taxonomy or a phylogenetic tree, so either taxonomic diversity or phylogenetic diversity indices are used in the algorithm. The X and Y polar coordinates for each sample are estimated using the following equations:

\tabular{ll}{
\eqn{X=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{4}|z_j|cos(\alpha)} \tab \eqn{Y=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{4}|z_j|sin(\alpha)}
}
where \emph{z} is the standardized value of the index \emph{j} of the four groups considered.

Each index is assigned an angle (\eqn{\alpha}). Degrees to radians angle conversion is carried out assuming that 1 degree = 0.0174532925 radians.

\strong{4.} With the polar coordinates of the samples obtained for each combination, it is calculated the convex hull (alpha = 6) and the mean Euclidean distance, and the values are saved in a file.

\strong{5.} The algorithm selects the combination of indices with the highest value of the mean between convex hull and mean Euclidean distance among samples, therefore priority is given to maximize dispersion among samples (see Fig. 1). The polar coordinates of the selected combination are depicted on a diagram, where it is possible to see the differences in rarity, heterogeneity, evenness and taxonomic/phylogenetic  diversity and/or functional diversity (if it is included) among assemblages.

\strong{6.} Finally, DER function allows the user to select the four/five indices to be used in the diagram, so the algorithm of selecting the combination with the maximum dispersion among samples is not applied.

\strong{FUNCTIONS}

The index Fisher alpha was estimated with the function \link[vegan]{fisher.alpha}, the index Rényi with the function \link[vegan]{renyi}, the index Tsallis with the function \link[vegan]{tsallis}, the taxonomic diversity and taxonomic distinctness with the functions \link[vegan]{taxa2dist} and \link[vegan]{taxondive}, all of them of the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2016). The ellipse is depicted with the function \link[shape]{plotellipse} of the package shape (Soetaert, 2016). The convex hull (alpha=6) was calculated with the function \link[splancs]{areapl} of the package splancs (Bivand et al., 2016). The color legend of DER plot was depicted with the function \link[plotrix]{color.legend} of the package plotrix (Lemon et al., 2016). The rarity index of Leroy was calculated with the functions \link[Rarity]{rWeights} and \link[Rarity]{Irr}, both of the package Rarity (Leroy et al., 2012; 2103; Leroy, 2016). The functional diversity indices were calculated with the function \link[FD]{dbFD} of the package FD (Laliberté et al., 2015). The phylogenetic indices were calculated with the functions psv, psr, pse, psc, raoD, mntd, mpd and pd of the package picante (Kembel et al. 2010 2016)

\strong{EXAMPLE}

The example without functional diversity is a dataset with the abundance of rotifers species in ponds (see table 1 in Mazuelos et al., 1993). In the argument \emph{Index} were selected Rarity, Menhinick, McIntoshE and Dstar, which are the indices selected by the algorithm when \emph{Index=NULL} (default option). The sample G3.1 had the lowest values of the indices of rarity, heterogeneity, evenness and taxonomic diversity and the pond I3.1 the highest values for all indices.
